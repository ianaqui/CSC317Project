## Directory Structure

Your project must follow this directory structure:

```
assignments/
└── assignment-5/
    ├── app.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── public/
    │   ├── css/
    │   ├── js/
    │   └── images/
    ├── routes/
    │   └── api/
    ├── views/
    ├── middleware/
    ├── models/
    ├── config/
    ├── utils/
    └── README.md
```

## Grading Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on:

1. **Functionality (40%)**
   - All features work as described
   - No major bugs or errors
   - Proper error handling

2. **Code Quality (25%)**
   - Well-structured and organized code
   - Proper comments and documentation
   - Follows best practices

3. **Design and User Experience (20%)**

## Important Notes

- **Individual Contribution**: All team members must contribute code. Zero code contribution will result in no credit for that student.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for collaboration and maintain a clear commit history.
- **Progress Updates**: Weekly check-ins will be required to ensure steady progress.
- **Technology Stack**: You may use additional libraries with instructor approval, but the core must be HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.js.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Push your code to GitHub under the specified directory structure
2. Submit your repository link through the class portal
3. Upload your demo video to the designated platform
4. Include a contribution.md file detailing each member's contributions

Good luck with your projects! This is your opportunity to showcase all you've learned throughout the course while gaining valuable collaborative development experience.
